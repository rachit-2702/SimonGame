I have been following a course on full Stack Webdev and the goal of this module was to create a basic replica of Simon game
### Working
When the game starts, A random tile flashes, the player must click on the same tile to clear the 1st level. In the 2nd level another tile will flash and the player must click on the tile of first level and then the tile of second level in order to clear this level. \
Similarly in every level a random tile flash is added to this sequence, thus at nth level there is a sequence of n tiles which the player must enter by clicking in exact order to clear that level. \
Game ends if the player clicks on the wrong tile. \
